## American keyboard layout for German, math, and currencies

Click the huge green button to proceed to instructions on how to **install** and **use**.

The idea is that we keep our favorite QWERTY layout with all special characters located where we're used to. Now, all we do is adding the needed characters to Alt+Ctrl so that we wouldn't need to switch the layout just to type a symbol (which is especially painful if you already have two or more layouts).

You can create your own layout with the official keyboard editor, see the last section of this page.

## All versions

All releases are [here](https://github.com/WhiteBlackGoose/AmericanKeyboardLayoutForGerman/releases) (in case if you want to find an old version).

## How it's done

I used awesome Microsoft's [Keyboard Layout Editor](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134).
